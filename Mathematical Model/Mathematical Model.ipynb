    "# Mathematical Model\n",
    "\n",
    "To better represent and make tools to solve the Capacited Vehicle Routing Problem using Linear Programming methods, we will use a mathematical model. This mathematical model turns the CVRP into linear relationships that represent its objective and constraints. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "A graph ($G$) will be used to represent the depot and the cities to deliver to. These geographical points will be the graph's verticles (which will be referred to as \"nodes\"). Those nodes are all linked together (making the graph complete), by edges whose values represent the distance between one node and another.\n",
    "- $K$ is the set of vehicles available. *$k$ will therefore, refer to an element of $K$.*\n",
    "- $V$ is the set of verticles (nodes).\n",
    "- $E$ is the set of edges.\n",
    "- $Q$ is the vehicles' cargo capacity \n",
    "- $d_i$ is the demand (total volume of products to be delivered) associated to the node $i$.\n",
    "- $c_{ij}$ is the cost associated to the edge $(i,j)$, which is the distance between the node $i$ and the node $j$. *In some implementations, $c_{ij}$ can be different than $c_{ji}$, as the route from city i to city y can be different than from city y to city i, depending on factors such as one-way roads*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision variable\n",
    "\n",
    "- $x_{ij}^k$ is equal to $1$ if the route represented by the edge $(i,j)$ is traveled by the vehicle $k$, if not, it's equal to $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective function\n",
    "\n",
    "Our model's objective function is the following:\n",
    "$$\\min \\sum_{k \\in K} \\sum_{i \\in V} \\sum_{j \\in V} c_{ij} x_{ij}^k$$\n",
    "As $\\min$ specifices it, the objective here is to minimize the result of this function, which means minimizing the total distance driven by the trucks.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. $\\sum_{j \\in V} x_{ij}^k = \\sum_{j \\in V} x_{ji}^k, \\quad \\forall i \\in V, \\forall k \\in K$\n",
    "\n",
    "This constraint makes sure that vehicles come out of the nodes they came in\n",
    "\n",
    "4. $\\sum_{i \\in V} d_i \\sum_{j \\in V} x_{ij}^k \\leq Q, \\quad \\forall k \\in K$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",

    "The following code uses PuLP, a linear problem modeler module that interfaces with solvers, for Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "As an input, it takes the available number of vehicle, their cargo capacity, cities to be delivered (their GPS coordinates (longitude and latitude) as well as their amount of demand) and the GPS coordinates to the depot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two ways can be used by this program to obtain the distances between GPS points in order to construct the graph:\n",
    "- either the Haversine formula is used to calculate the distance \"as the crow flies\",\n",
    "- or an OpenRouteService server can be used in order to obtain the actual distance, driving a vehicle on the road using the shortest route found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Using OpenRouteService will produce a result that is more accurate, but it takes more time. However, no matter the choice, the key limiting factor to this way of finding a solution to a CVRP instance is the use of a solver.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, while solving an instance that contains around 10 cities to deliver to is a matter of seconds, the time expands exponentially as more cities get input. For example, it took us 7 hours to complete an instance that contained 15 cities. Furthemore, the amount of RAM needed also expands exponentially. This makes it impossible to solve instances of the sizes expected for this project. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a metaheuristic\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, our final program will not use a solver software, but a metaheuristic.\n",
    "For big instances, metaheuristics are way faster than using a solver. The only downside to metaheuristics is that they don't always give the best possible solution, but they produce solutions whose quality are perfectly acceptable. "
